<span><b>“It is better to conquer yourself than to win a thousand battles. Then the victory is yours. It cannot be taken from you.” -Buddha

   <br> “If you knew what I know about the power of giving you would not let a single meal pass without sharing it in some way.”
    
 <br> “Learn this from water: loud splashes the brook but the oceans depth are calm.”
    <br>“I never see what has been done; I only see what remains to be done.”
   <br> “You only lose what you cling to.”
   <br> “The past is already gone, the future is not yet here. There’s only one moment for you to live.”
    <br>“The trouble is, you think you have time.”
<br>“Your work is to discover your work and then with all your heart to give yourself to it.”
<br>“Believe nothing, no matter where you read it, or who said it, no matter if I have said it, unless it agrees with your own reason and your own common sense.”
<br>“The tongue like a sharp knife… Kills without drawing blood.”
<br>“Teach this triple truth to all: A generous heart, kind speech, and a life of service and compassion are the things which renew humanity.”</b></span>
