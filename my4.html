<h1>Chicken Soup for the Soul</h1>

  by Jack Canfield and Mark Hansen 
  
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  
  <p class="soup">We know everything we need to know to end the needless emotional 
  suffering that many people currently experience. High self-esteem and 
  personal effectiveness are available to anyone willing to take the time to 
  pursue them. 
  
  It is difficult to translate the spirit of a live presentation into the written 
  word. Stories we tell every day have had to be rewritten five times to 
  work as well in print as they do live. When you are reading these 
  stories, please forget everything you ever learned in your speed-reading 
  classes. Slow down. Listen to the words in your heart as well as in your 
  mind. Savor each story. Let it touch you. Ask yourself, what does it 
  awaken in me? What does it suggest for my life? What feeling or action 
  does it call forth from my inner being? Let yourself have a personal 
  relationship with each story. 
  
  Some stories will speak louder to you than others. Some will have 
  deeper meaning. Some will make you cry. Some will make you laugh. 
  Some will give you a warm feeling all over. Some may hit you right 
  between the eyes. There is no right reaction. There is only your reaction. 
  Let it happen and let it be. 
  
  Don't hurry through this book. Take your time. Enjoy it. Savor it. 
  Engage it with your whole being. It represents thousands of hours of 
  culling the "best of the best" from our 40 years of combined experience. 
  One last thing: Reading a book like this is a little like sitting down to eat 
  a meal of all desserts. It may be a little too rich. It is a meal with no 
  vegetables, salad or bread. It is all essence with very little froth. 
  In our seminars and workshops we take more time to set up and discuss 
  the implications of each story. There are more explanations and 
  explorations of how to apply the lessons and principles to your everyday 
  life. Don't just read these stories. Take the time to digest them and make 
  them your own. 
  </p>
  
  
  
  <p class="soup">If you find yourself moved to share a story with others, do it. When a 
  
  story makes you think of another person, call the person it brings to 
  
  mind and share it. Engage these stories and let them move you to do 
  
  whatever comes up for you. They are meant to inspire and motivate you. 
  
  For a lot of these stories we went back to the original source and asked 
  
  them to write it or tell it in their own words. Many of the stories will be 
  
  in their voice, not ours. We have attributed every story we could to the 
  
  original source. For all of those that are from fellow speakers and 
  
  trainers, we have included a contributors section in the back of the book 
  
  where we have listed their name, address and phone number so you can 
  
  contact them yourself if you wish. 
  
  We hope you will enjoy reading this book as much as we have enjoyed 
  
  writing it.

  <h1>ON LOVE</h1> 
  
  <p class="soup">The day will come when, after harnessing space, the winds, the tides 
  and gravitation, we shall harness for God the energies of love. And on 
  that day, for the second time in the history of the world, we shall have 
  discovered fire. 
  Tielhard de Chardin 
  
  Love: The One Creative Force 
  
  Spread love everywhere you go: first of all in your own house. Give 
  love to your children, to your wife or husband, to a next door neighbor. . 
  . . Let no one ever come to you without leaving better and happier. Be 
  the living expression of God's kindness; kindness in your face, kindness 
  in your eyes, kindness in your smile, kindness in your warm greeting. 
  Mother Teresa 
  
  A college professor had his sociology class go into the Baltimore slums 
  to get case histories of 200 young boys. They were asked to write an 
  evaluation of each boy's future. In every case the students wrote, "He 
  hasn't got a chance." Twenty- five years later another sociology 
  professor came across the earlier study. He had his students follow up 
  on the project to see what had happened to these boys. With the 
  exception of 20 boys who had moved away or died, the students learned 
  that 176 of the remaining 180 had achieved more than ordinary success 
  as lawyers, doctors and businessmen. 
  
  The professor was astounded and decided to pursue the matter further. 
  Fortunately, all the men were in the area and he was able to ask each 
  one, "How do you account for your success?" In each case the reply 
  came with feeling, 'There was a teacher." 
  
  The teacher was still alive, so he sought her out and asked the old but 
  still alert lady what magic formula she had used to pull these boys out of 
  the slums into successful achievement. 
  
  The teacher's eyes sparkled and her lips broke into a gentle smile. "It's 
  really very simple," she said. "I loved those boys."

  <h1>All I Remember </h1>
  
  <p class="soup">When my father spoke to me, he always began the conversation with 
  "Have I told you yet today how much I adore you?" The expression of 
  love was reciprocated and, in his later years, as his life began to visibly 
  ebb, we grew even closer.... if that were possible. 
  At 82 he was ready to die, and I was ready to let him go so that his 
  suffering would end. We laughed and cried and held hands and told 
  each other of our love and agreed that it was time. I said, "Dad, after 
  you've gone I want a sign from you that you're fine." He laughed at the 
  absurdity of that; Dad didn't believe in reincarnation. I wasn't positive I 
  did either, but I had had many experiences that convinced me I could 
  get some signal "from the other side." 
  
  My father and I were so deeply connected I felt his heart attack in my 
  chest at the moment he died. Later I mourned that the hospital, in their 
  sterile wisdom, had not let me hold his hand as he had slipped away. 
  Day after day I prayed to hear from him, but nothing happened. Night 
  after night I asked for a dream before I fell asleep. And yet four long 
  months passed and I heard and felt nothing but grief at his loss. Mother 
  had died five years before of Alzheimer's, and, though I had grown 
  daughters of my own, I felt like a lost child. 
  One day, while I was lying on a massage table in a dark quiet room 
  waiting for my appointment, a wave of longing for my father swept over 
  me. I began to wonder if I had been too demanding in asking for a sign 
  from him. I noticed that my mind was in a hyper-acute state. I 
  experienced an unfamiliar clarity in which I could have added long 
  columns of figures in my head. I checked to make sure I was awake and 
  not dreaming, and I saw that I was as far removed from a dreamy state 
  as one could possibly be. Each thought I had, was like a drop of water 
  disturbing a still pond, and I marveled at the peacefulness of each 
  passing moment. Then I thought, "I've been trying to control the 
  messages from the other side; I will stop that now." 
  Suddenly my mother's face appeared — my mother, as she had been 
  before Alzheimer's disease had stripped her of her mind, her humanity 
  and 50 pounds. Her magnificent silver hair crowned her sweet face. She 
  was so real and so close I felt I could reach out and touch her. She 
  looked as she had a dozen years ago, before the wasting away had 
  begun. I even smelled the fragrance of Joy, her favorite perfume. She 
  
  
  
  seemed to be waiting and did not speak. I wondered how it could 
  
  happen that I was thinking of my father and my mother appeared, and I 
  
  felt a little guilty that I had not asked for her as well. 
  
  I said, "Oh, Mother, I'm so sorry that you had to suffer with that horrible 
  
  disease." 
  
  She tipped her head slightly to one side, as though to acknowledge what 
  
  I had said about her suffering. Then she smiled — a beautiful smile — and 
  
  said very distinctiy, "But all I remember is love." And she disappeared. 
  
  I began to shiver in a room suddenly gone cold, and I knew in my bones 
  
  that the love we give and receive is all that matters and all that is 
  
  remembered. Suffering disappears - love remains. 
  
  Her words are the most important I have ever heard, and that moment is 
  
  forever engraved on my heart. 
  
  I have not yet seen or heard from my father, but I have no doubts that 
  
  someday, when I least expect it, he will appear and say, "Have I told 
  
  you yet today that I love you?"

  <h1>Heart Song </h1>
  
  <p class="soup">Once upon a time there was a great man who married the woman of his 
  
  dreams. With their love, they created a little girl. She was a bright and 
  
  cheerful little girl and the great man loved her very much. 
  
  When she was very little, he would pick her up, hum a tune and dance 
  
  with her around the room, and he would tell her, "I love you, little girl." 
  
  When the little girl was growing up, the great man would hug her and 
  
  tell her, "I love you, little girl." The little girl would pout and say, "I'm 
  
  not a little girl anymore." Then the man would laugh and say, "But to 
  
  me, you'll always be my little girl." 
  
  The little girl who-was-not-little-anymore left her home and went into 
  
  the world. As she learned more about herself, she learned more about 
  
  the man. She saw that he truly was great and strong, for now she 
  
  recognized his strengths. One of his strengths was his ability to express 
  
  his love to his family. It didn't matter where she went in the world, the 
  
  man would call her and say, "I love you, little girl." 
  
  The day came when the little girl who-was-not-little-anymore received a 
  
  phone call. The great man was damaged. 
  
  He had had a stroke. He was aphasic, they explained to the girl. He 
  
  couldn't talk anymore and they weren't sure that he could understand the 
  
  words spoken to him. He could no longer smile, laugh, walk, hug, dance 
  
  or tell the little girl who-was-not-littie-anymore that he loved her. 
  
  And so she went to the side of the great man. When she walked into the 
  
  room and saw him, he looked small and not strong at all. He looked at 
  
  her and tried to speak, but he could not. 
  
  The little girl did the only thing she could do. She climbed up on the bed 
  
  next to the great man. Tears ran from both of their eyes and she drew 
  
  her arms around the useless shoulders of her father. 
  
  Her head on his chest, she thought of many things. She remembered the 
  
  wonderful times together and how she had always felt protected and 
  
  cherished by the great man. She felt grief for the loss she was to endure, 
  
  the words of love that had comforted her. 
  
  And then she heard from within the man, the beat of his heart. The heart 
  
  where the music and the words had always lived. The heart beat on, 
  
  steadily unconcerned about the damage to the rest of the body. And 
  
  while she rested there, the magic happened. She heard what she needed 
  
  to hear. 
  
  His heart beat out the words that his mouth could no longer say. 
  I love you I love you I love you Little girl Little girl Little girl 
  And she was comforted.

  <h1>True Love</h1> 
  
  <p class="soup">Moses Mendelssohn, the grandfather of the well-known German 
  
  composer, was far from being handsome. Along with a rather short 
  
  stature, he had a grotesque hunchback. 
  
  One day he visited a merchant in Hamburg who had a lovely daughter 
  
  named Frumtje. Moses fell hopelessly in love with her. But Frumtje was 
  
  repulsed by his misshapen appearance. 
  
  When it came time for him to leave, Moses gathered his courage and 
  
  climbed the stairs to her room to take one last opportunity to speak with 
  
  her. She was a vision of heavenly beauty, but caused him deep sadness 
  
  by her refusal to look at him. After several attempts at conversation, 
  
  Moses shyly asked, "Do you believe marriages are made in heaven?" 
  
  "Yes," she answered, still looking at the floor. "And do you?" 
  
  "Yes I do," he replied. "You see, in heaven at the birth of each boy, the 
  
  Lord announces which girl he will marry. When I was born, my future 
  
  bride was pointed out to me. Then the Lord added, 'But your wife will 
  
  be humpbacked.' 
  
  "Right then and there I called out, 'Oh Lord, a humpbacked woman 
  
  would be a tragedy. Please, Lord, give me the hump and let her be 
  
  beautiful.'" 
  
  Then Frumtje looked up into his eyes and was stirred by some deep 
  
  memory. She reached out and gave Mendelssohn her hand and later 
  
  became his devoted wife.

  <h1>The Hugging Judge</h1> 
  
  <p class="soup">'Don't bug me! Hug me!' - Bumper Sticker 
  
  Lee Shapiro is a retired judge. He is also one of the most genuinely 
  loving people we know. At one point in his career, Lee realized that 
  love is the greatest power there is. As a result, Lee became a hugger. He 
  began offering everybody a hug. His colleagues dubbed him "the 
  hugging judge" (as opposed to the hanging judge, we suppose). The 
  bumper sticker on his car reads, "Don't bug me! Hug me!" 
  About six years ago Lee created what he calls his Hugger Kit. On the 
  outside it reads "A heart for a hug." The inside contains thirty little red 
  embroidered hearts with stickums on the back. Lee will take out his 
  Hugger Kit, go around to people and offer them a little red heart in 
  exchange for a hug. 
  
  Lee has become so well known for this that he is often invited to 
  keynote conferences and conventions, where he shares his message of 
  unconditional love. At a conference in San Francisco, the local news 
  media challenged him by saying, "It is easy to give out hugs here in the 
  conference to people who self-selected to be here. But this would never 
  work in the real world." 
  
  They challenged Lee to give away some hugs on the streets of San 
  Francisco. Followed by a television crew from the local news station, 
  Lee went out onto the street. First he approached a woman walking by. 
  "Hi, I'm Lee Shapiro, the hugging judge. I'm giving out these hearts in 
  exchange for a hug." "Sure," she replied. "Too easy," challenged the 
  local commentator. Lee looked around. He saw a meter maid who was 
  being given a hard time by the owner of a BMW to whom she was 
  giving a ticket. He marched up to her, camera crew in tow, and said, 
  "You look like you could use a hug. I'm the hugging judge and I'm 
  offering you one." She accepted. 
  
  The television commentator threw down one final challenge. "Look, 
  here comes a bus. San Francisco bus drivers are the toughest, crabbiest, 
  meanest people in the whole town. Let's see you get him to hug you." 
  Lee took the challenge. 
  
  As the bus pulled up to the curb, Lee said, "Hi, I'm Lee Shapiro, the 
  hugging judge. This has got to be one of the most stressful jobs in the 
  whole world. I'm offering hugs to people today to lighten the load a 
  
  
  
  little. Would you like one?" The six-foot-two, 230-pound bus driver got 
  
  out of his seat, stepped down and said, "Why not?" 
  
  Lee hugged him, gave him a heart and waved good-bye as the bus 
  
  pulled out. The TV crew was speechless. Finally, the commentator said, 
  
  "I have to admit, I'm very impressed." 
  
  One day Lee's friend Nancy Johnston showed up on his doorstep. Nancy 
  
  is a professional clown and she was wearing her clown costume, 
  
  makeup and all. "Lee, grab a bunch of your Hugger Kits and let's go out 
  
  to the home for the disabled." 
  
  When they arrived at the home, they started giving out balloon hats, 
  
  hearts and hugs to the patients. Lee was uncomfortable. He had never 
  
  before hugged people who were terminally ill, severely retarded or 
  
  quadriplegic. It was definitely a stretch. But after a while it became 
  
  easier, with Nancy and Lee acquiring an entourage of doctors, nurses 
  
  and orderlies who followed them from ward to ward. 
  
  After several hours they entered the last ward. These were 34 of the 
  
  worst cases Lee had seen in his life. The feeling was so grim it took his 
  
  heart away. But out of their commitment to share their love and to make 
  
  a difference, Nancy and Lee started working their way around the room 
  
  followed by the entourage of medical staff, all of whom by now had 
  
  hearts on their collars and balloon hats on their heads. 
  
  Finally, Lee came to the last person, Leonard. Leonard was wearing a 
  
  big white bib which he was drooling on. Lee looked at Leonard 
  
  dribbling onto his bib and said, "Let's go, Nancy. There's no way we can 
  
  get through to this person." Nancy replied, "C'mon, Lee. He's a fellow 
  
  human being, too, isn't he?" Then she placed a funny balloon hat on his 
  
  head. Lee took one of his little red hearts and placed it on Leonard's bib. 
  
  He took a deep breath, leaned down and gave Leonard a hug. 
  
  All of a sudden Leonard began to squeal, "Eeeeehh! Eeeeeehh!" Some 
  
  of the other patients in the room began to clang things together. Lee 
  
  turned to the staff for some sort of explanation only to find that every 
  
  doctor, nurse and orderly was crying. Lee asked the head nurse, "What's 
  
  going on?" 
  
  Lee will never forget what she said: "This is the first time in 23 years 
  
  we've ever seen Leonard smile." 
  
  How simple it is to make a difference in the lives of others.

  <h1>It Can't Happen Here?</h1>
  
  <p class="soup">We need 4 hugs a day for survival. We need 8 hugs a day for 
  maintenance. We need 12 hugs a day for growth. 
  Virginia Satir 
  
  We always teach people to hug each other in our workshops and 
  seminars. Most people respond by saying, "You could never hug people 
  where I work." Are you sure? 
  Here is a letter from a graduate of one of our seminars. 
  
  Dear Jack, 
  
  I started out this day in rather a bleak mood. My friend Rosalind 
  
  stopped over and asked me if I was giving hugs today. I just grumbled 
  
  something but then I began to think about hugs and everything during 
  
  the week. I would look at the sheet you gave us on How to Keep the 
  
  Seminar Alive and I would cringe when I got to the part about giving 
  
  and getting hugs because I couldn't imagine giving hugs to the people at 
  
  work. 
  
  Well I decided to make it "hugs day" and I started giving hugs to the 
  
  customers who came to my counter. It was great to see how people just 
  
  brightened up. An MBA student jumped up on top of the counter and 
  
  did a dance. Some people actually came back and asked for more. These 
  
  two Xerox repair guys, who were kind of just walking along not really 
  
  talking to each other, were so surprised, they just woke up and suddenly 
  
  were talking and laughing down the hall. 
  
  It feels like I hugged everybody in the Wharton Business School, plus 
  
  whatever was wrong with me this morning, which included some 
  
  physical pain, is all gone. I'm sorry that this letter is so long but I'm just 
  
  really excited. The neatest thing was, at one point there were about 10 
  
  people all hugging each other out in front of my counter. I couldn't 
  
  believe this was happening. 
  
  Love, Pamela Rogers 
  
  P.S.: On the way home I hugged a policeman on 37th Street. He said, 
  
  "Wow! Policemen never get hugs. Are you sure you don't want to throw 
  
  something at me?" 
  
  
  
  Another seminar graduate sent us the following piece on hugging: 
  
  Hugging Is 
  
  Hugging is healthy. It helps the immune system, cures depression, 
  
  reduces stress and induces sleep. It's invigorating, rejuvenating and has 
  
  no unpleasant side effects. Hugging is nothing less than a miracle drug. 
  
  Hugging is all natural. It is organic, naturally sweet, no artificial 
  
  ingredients, nonpolluting, environmentally friendly and 100 percent 
  
  wholesome. 
  
  Hugging is the ideal gift. Great for any occasion, fun to give and 
  
  receive, shows you care, comes with its awn wrapping and, of course, 
  
  fully returnable. 
  
  Hugging is practically perfect. No batteries to wear out, inflation-proof, 
  
  nonfattening, no monthly payments, theft-proof and nontaxable. 
  
  Hugging is an underutilized resource with magical powers. When we 
  
  open our hearts and arms, we encourage others to do the same. 
  
  Think of the people in your life. Are there any words you'd like to say? 
  
  Are there any hugs you want to share? Are you waiting and hoping 
  
  someone else will ask first? Please don't wait! Initiate!

<h1>Who You Are Makes A Difference</h1> 

<p class="soup">A teacher in New York decided to honor each of her seniors in high 
school by telling them the difference they each made. Using a process 
developed by Helice Bridges of Del Mar, California, she called each 
student to the front of the class, one at a time. First she told them how 
the student made a difference to her and the class. Then she presented 
each of them with a blue ribbon imprinted with gold letters which read, 
"Who I Am Makes a Difference." 

Afterwards the teacher decided to do a class project to see what kind of 
impact recognition would have on a community. She gave each of the 
students three more ribbons and instructed them to go out and spread 
this acknowledgment ceremony. Then they were to follow up on the 
results, see who honored whom and report back to the class in about a 
week 

One of the boys in the class went to a junior executive in a nearby 
company and honored him for helping him with his career planning. He 
gave him a blue ribbon and put it on his shirt. Then he gave him two 
extra ribbons, and said, "We're doing a class project on recognition, and 
we'd like you to go out, find somebody to honor, give them a blue 
ribbon, then give them the extra blue ribbon so they can acknowledge a 
third person to keep this acknowledgment ceremony going. Then please 
report back to me and tell me what happened." 

Later that day the junior executive went in to see his boss, who had been 
noted, by the way, as being kind of a grouchy fellow. He sat his boss 
down and he told him that he deeply admired him for being a creative 
genius. The boss seemed very surprised. The junior executive asked him 
if he would accept the gift of the blue ribbon and would he give him 
permission to put it on him. His surprised boss said, "Well, sure." 
The junior executive took the blue ribbon and placed it right on his 
boss's jacket above his heart. As he gave him the last extra ribbon, he 
said, "Would you do me a favor? Would you take this extra ribbon and 
pass it on by honoring somebody else? The young boy who first gave 
me the ribbons is doing a project in school and we want to keep this 
recognition ceremony going and find out how it affects people." 



That night the boss came home to his 14-year-old son and sat him down. 
He said, "The most incredible thing happened to me today. I was in my 
office and one of the junior executives came in and told me he admired 
me and gave me a blue ribbon for being a creative genius. Imagine. He 
thinks I'm a creative genius. Then he put this blue ribbon that says 'Who 
I Am Makes A Difference' on my jacket above my heart. He gave me an 
extra ribbon and asked me to find somebody else to honor. As I was 
driving home tonight, I started thinking about whom I would honor with 
this ribbon and I thought about you. I want to honor you. 
"My days are really hectic and when I come home I don't pay a lot of 
attention to you. Sometimes I scream at you for not getting good enough 
grades in school and for your bedroom being a mess, but somehow 
tonight, I just wanted to sit here and, well, just let you know that you do 
make a difference to me. Besides your mother, you are the most 
important person in my life. You're a great kid and I love you!" 
The startled boy started to sob and sob, and he couldn't stop crying. His 
whole body shook. He looked up at his father and said through his tears, 
"I was planning on committing suicide tomorrow, Dad, because I didn't 
think you loved me. Now I don't need to."

<h1>One At A Time</h1> 

<p class="soup">A friend of ours was walking down a deserted Mexican beach at sunset. 

As he walked along, he began to see another man in the distance. As he 

grew nearer, he noticed that the local native kept leaning down, picking 

something up and throwing it out into the water. Time and again he kept 

hurling things out into the ocean. 

As our friend approached even closer, he noticed that the man was 

picking up starfish that had been washed up on the beach and, one at a 

time, he was throwing them back into the water. 

Our friend was puzzled. He approached the man and said, "Good 

evening, friend. I was wondering what you are doing." 

"I'm throwing these starfish back into the ocean. You see, it's low tide 

right now and all of these starfish have been washed up onto the shore. 

If I don't throw them back into the sea, they'll die up here from lack of 

oxygen." 

"I understand," my friend replied, "but there must be thousands of 

starfish on this beach. You can't possibly get to all of them. There are 

simply too many. And don't you realize this is probably happening on 

hundreds of beaches all up and down this coast. Can't you see that 

you can't possibly make a difference?" 

The local native smiled, bent down and picked up yet another starfish, 

and as he threw it back into the sea, he replied, "Made a difference to 

that one!"

<h1>The Gift</h1> 

<p class="soup">Bennet Cerf relates this touching story about a bus that was bumping 
along a back road in the South. 

In one seat a wispy old man sat holding a bunch of fresh flowers. 
Across the aisle was a young girl whose eyes came back again and 
again to the man's flowers. The time came for the old man to get off. 
Impulsively he thrust the flowers into the girl's lap. "I can see you love 
the flowers," he explained, "and I think my wife would like for you to 
have them. I'll tell her I gave them to you." The girl accepted the 
flowers, then watched the old man get off the bus and walk through the 
gate of a small cemetery.
